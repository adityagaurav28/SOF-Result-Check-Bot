# SOF-Result-Check-Bot
A python bot to check the SOF olympiad result of students at a single time and also summarizing the result. 
##Motive
A few days ago my brothers SOF NSO(National Science Olympiad) result came out. He stood second in the class and he wanted to know who came first. He started searching the result of each and every student in his class one by one. On seeing that, I told him that it can be easily done using a bot. His reply "You are done? Now let me search the results."
This incident led me to develop this bot. Although it's an silly idea and might not be used by many. But, it's the perfect thing for those who are competitive in nature and want their rivals result. 
##Requirements

Pandas
Chrome Browser
